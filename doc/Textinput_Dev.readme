This file is intended to provide information for developers working on
Textinput through the cvs at water.vapor.com. Feel free to add guidelines,
information, suggestions, etc. which you feel would be relevant to the other
programmers.

SAS/C is the recommended compiler for this project, and it is unlikely that it
will work with any other without changes.

Don't forget to add all appropriate changes to Textinput.readme (which is
formatted to 79 columns), postfixed with your nick in brackets.


Notes
-----

- Version 22.0 (first upload to the cvs) has a fair amount of code commented
  out. This is to eliminate relatively untested features from an imminent
  public release.
- Values for most prefs options which are set by the app are overridden in the
  next MUIM_Setup.


Todo
----

- Optionally wordwrap on every operation, not just character entry.
- Fix bold characters and those with negative kerning being clipped during
  cursor movement.
- Fully localise.
- Fix rendering text in JAM2 mode over a pattern background (the writemask may
  not cover all pens of the pattern).
- Make setting MUIA_Textinput_Contents and MUIM_Textinput_LoadFromFile
  undoable.
- Make wordwrap work better with undo/redo.
- Add volume/assign/path completion.
- Add image support in MUI styles.
- Add separator bar support (a la NList).
- Optionally hide cursor when marking.
- Optionally show cursor (ghosted/outlined) when inactive.
- Add user-definable tab, EOL and EOF (NULL) character rendering.
- Make email styles more intelligent.
- Individual design/colour prefs for single/multiline input/noinput gadgets.
- Add AlphaSpell support.
- Add spelling suggestions in a popup list (I'm working on this -KingGuppy).
- Add spell-checker prefs (e.g. language) to Textinput.mcp.
- Add optional beep (or other events?) on misspelling.
- Add dynamic wordwrap, based on object width.
- Add dynamic scrollbar hide/show (like NList).
- Add smooth scrolling.
- Allow user-definable pattern backgrounds in input gadgets.
